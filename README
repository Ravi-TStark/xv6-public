BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

To build xv6 on an x86 ELF machine (like Linux or FreeBSD), run
"make". On non-x86 or non-ELF machines (like OS X, even on x86), you
will need to install a cross-compiler gcc suite capable of producing
x86 ELF binaries (see https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/).
Then run "make TOOLPREFIX=i386-jos-elf-". Now install the QEMU PC
simulator and run "make qemu" or "make qemu-nox" depending on the Machine.

Priority Bit Implementation:

Range available:
0 - Low 
1 - BelowNormal
2 - Normal
3 - AboveNormal
4 - High
5 - RealTime

To test the priority bit implementation, Press Ctrl+P (^P) or run the "ps" command to print the list of all processes.
The data is formatted in the following way: (Process ID) (Process state) (Process Name) (Process Priority)

To check implementation of the system call to change process priority, run any process in the background using the 
following command pattern - "(program) &". To make sure that a process run long enough to test functionality, a
dummy program is included, which when run in the background stays alove long enough to test our system call.

Now to change the priority of any process, run the following command - "cp (pid) (n_p)", where (pid) is the id of 
the process whose priority we wish to change, and (n_p) is the new priority.
